# FluxGate
 simple full-stack app that sends user prompts to different AI models based on how long and complex the prompt is. 

 If the task is very small and non demanding , the user is routed to the small language model,

 if it exceeds a certain limit then the user is given the fast model, 

 else if the prompt is long and or seems to be complex the user is routed to the deep reasoning model

 Nothing too big, just a large impact
